# Thanksgiving Scavenger Hunt
This program is a scavenger hunt/trivia game for families on Thanksgiving. The game features 10 barcodes which need to be placed around the house following the clues. If a user scans the barcode, a Thanksgiving trivia quesiton appears with three answers; if the user selects the right answer, the clue to the next barcode appears. If they quess wrong, they lose 5 seconds and have to try again.

Hope you enjoy!
